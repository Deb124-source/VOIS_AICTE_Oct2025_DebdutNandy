## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Source**: [Airbnb Hotel Booking Dataset](https://voisfortech.com/storage/files/1730285881-Airbnb_Open_Data.xlsx)
- Contains information on hotel bookings, customer demographics, stay details, and cancellations.

## ⚙️ Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
   - Treated outliers in booking/cancellation data  
   - Standardized columns for consistency  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of bookings by hotel type, country, and customer segment  
   - Seasonal trends in reservations and cancellations  
   - Relationship between lead time, price, and cancellations  

3. **Conversational Data Analysis**  
   - Used **Google Colab** + **Julius AI** to query the dataset in natural language  
   - Enabled interactive exploration and dynamic insights  

4. **Insights & Visualization**  
   - Created charts (bar plots, histograms, heatmaps) for better interpretation  
   - Highlighted patterns in booking behavior
